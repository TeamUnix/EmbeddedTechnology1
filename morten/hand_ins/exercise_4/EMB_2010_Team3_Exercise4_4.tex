\section{Introduction}
The job is to create a spi.c (and a spi.h) file containing two functions. A initialization of the SPI line and a transfer function.
Sending data from the master device (the LPC2478) to its slave devices (the display- and touch controllers). 
Also the goal with this exercise is to read and understand code provided by others, where small changes can/should be done to
fit the project it should be used.
\section{Initialization}
In the calib\_app.c function the SPIInit function is called with some parameters, therefore a function has been build that takes these parameters. The parameters are: Clock, Framesize, CPHA, CPOL, LSBF.

\begin{lstlisting}
void SPIInit(short wClock, char nFramesize, char bCPHA, char bCPOL, char bLSBF){
	//1. Power: In the PCONP register set bit PCSPI.
	//Remark: On reset, the SPI is enabled (PCSPI = 1).

	//2. Clock: In PCLK_SEL0 select PCLK_SPI.
	//In master mode, the clock must be scaled down.
		//2.1: PCLKSEL0 &= ~((1<<16) | (1<<17));		//Default value CCLK/4
		//2.2: PCLKSEL0 |= (1<<16);									//CCLK
		//   PCLKSEL0 &= ~(1<<17);
		//2.3:																			//CCLK/2 = 28.8MHz
			 PCLKSEL0 |= (1<<17);
			 PCLKSEL0 &= ~(1<<16);
		//2.4: PCLKSEL0 |= ((1<<17) | (1<<16)); 		//CCLK/8
	//3. Pins: Select SPI pins and their modes in PINSEL0 to
		//SCK: P0.15  MISO: P0.17  MOSI: P0.18
			PINSEL0 |= (1<<31);
			PINSEL1 |= ((1<<3) | (1<<5));
	//4. Interrupts: Interrupts are not used

	//All SPI registers:
		//RW SPI Control Register (Master Mode)
	S0SPCR	= ((1<<2)|(bCPHA<<3)|(bCPOL<<4)|(1<<5)|(bLSBF<<6)|(nFramesize<<8));
	//S0SPSR = 0;		//RO SPI Status Register (Read Only)
	//S0SPDR = 0;		//RW SPI Data Register
	S0SPCCR = wClock;	//RW SPI Clock Counter Register
	//S0SPINT = 0;		//RW SPI Interrupt Register
}
\end{lstlisting}

The send spi function:
\begin{lstlisting}
unsigned short SpiXfer(unsigned short nData){
	unsigned int errorcount = 0;

		//Put data to be sent into the data register
	S0SPDR = nData;
		//Wait for the transfer complete flag to go high
		//If it has not occured before 10000 clocs the function returns an error
	while ((S0SPSR & 0x80) == 0 && errorcount < 10000);
		errorcount++;

	return (S0SPDR);
}

\end{lstlisting}
