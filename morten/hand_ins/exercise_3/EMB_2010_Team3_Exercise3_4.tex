\section{Some Introduction}
This exercise is about controlling the backlight of the screen on the Embedded Artists board. 
The backlight should be controlled with an output pin from the LPC2478 setup as an PWM port.
The PWM driver should use PWM1[1] and connect it to pin 1.18 (this pin controls the intensity of the LCD displays backlight).
